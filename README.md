# AARRR metrics for a subscription-based book app

AARRR is a collection of metrics to measure any business:

* Acquisition
* Activation
* Retention
* Revenue
* Referral

:iphone: In this project, I'm working with a data warehouse of a fictional startup named Bindle. Bindle has a mobile and a web apps for reading books. It charges users monthly or yearly subscription fee.

:bar_chart: In the project, we'll build charts with basic AARRR metrics for Bindle.

## Acquisition

Let's see how many users sign up for Bindle daily, where they are coming from, what are the biggest acquisition channels are on web and mobile.

### Daily signups

Although the absolute number of signups might seem a vanity metric, it's nice to visualize it and track our day-to-day growth trends.

Here's the query behind this dashboard:

~~~pgsql
SELECT
  created_at::date AS d,
  COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM users
WHERE
  created_at > now() - '1 month'::interval
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
~~~

<div>
  <img align="left" src="./images/charts/daily_signups.png" alt="Daily signups in the past 30 days" width="75%">

  A number of new user accounts created per day for the past 30 days.
</div>

<br clear="left"/>
<br>

### Daily organic vs paid signups

Let's transform the absolute-number vanity metric into something more actionable. What drives our growth? Let's see the ratio between organic signups and users we acquired through marketing campaigns:

~~~pgsql
SELECT
  created_at::date AS d,
  CASE WHEN utm_medium IS NULL THEN 'organic' ELSE 'paid' END AS user_source,
  COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM users
WHERE
  date_part('year', created_at) = 2018
  AND date_part('month', created_at) = 2
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
~~~

<div>
  <img align="right" src="./images/charts/daily_organic_vs_paid_signups.png" alt="Daily organic vs paid signups" width="75%">

  A number of new organic and paid user accounts created per day for the past 30 days.
</div>

<br clear="right"/>
<br>

### Biggest marketing channels

Let's zoom into paid signups and see which channels and campaigns drive our growth.

~~~pgsql
SELECT
  utm_source,
  utm_campaign,
  utm_content,
  COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM users
WHERE
  date_part('year', created_at) = 2018
  AND date_part('month', created_at) = 2
  AND utm_medium IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
~~~

<div>
  <img align="left" src="./images/charts/biggest_marketing_channels.png" alt="Biggest marketing channels" width="75%">

  As you can see, Twitter and Facebook are our primary paid CPC marketing channels.
</div>
